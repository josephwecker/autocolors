Principles
==========

* Palettes for mono -> 8 -> 16 -> 80 -> 255 -> ffffff
* Schemes for
  - terminal emulators
  - terminal programs (email readers etc.)
  - editors
    - vim
    - emacs
    - textmate
  - syntax highlighters
    - pygments
    - perldoc
 (many, many more to come)

* Possibly customized per language (different densities)
* Properly balanced for transitions across semantics/syntax/focuses
* Really good looking
* Random. muahaha
