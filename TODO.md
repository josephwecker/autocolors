- [ ] A real good sample syntax/document with "common" densities for displaying full colorsheme - both standard and extended.
- [ ] Autogenerate some vim examples in order to test colorschemes generally for iterating
- [ ] Fix highlight color so it's more coherent
- [ ] Fix TODO / etc. so they're more coherent
- [~] Change mapping a bit so that one tick is very small variation, and more ticks increase but linearly, and use more ticks in most places.
- [ ] Fix vim "~"-line background color so it's only very slightly different from normal background.
- [ ] Heroku site for showing it off / generating them online
- [ ] Indicate frequency and average sizes in mapping - for use in constraints
- [ ] Constraints - make sure certain groups/mappings end up with colors that are far enough apart, or not too far apart, etc. etc. After first pass colors, modify according to constraints until it's stable.
- [ ] Fix translation to 256-colorspace
- [ ] Fix translation to 16-colorspace
- [ ] Fix overall mapping structure heirarchy
- [ ] Finish out all vim (esp. ui at this point) groups
- [ ] Fix commandline interface so it is standard and good
- [ ] Integrate with http://bashish.sourceforge.net/ ?
