## Urgent ##
- [ ] Fix color spread variety (gets too close on deep syntax elements- not enough variety)
- [ ] Fix translation to 256-colorspace
- [ ] Fix translation to 16-colorspace
- [ ] Fix commandline interface so it is standard and good

## Normal ##
- [ ] Fix vim "~"-line background color so it's only very slightly (more slightly) different from normal background.
- [ ] Heroku site for showing it off / generating them online
- [ ] Indicate frequency and average sizes in mapping - for use in constraints
- [ ] Constraints - make sure certain groups/mappings end up with colors that are far enough apart, or not too far apart, etc. etc. After first pass colors, modify according to constraints until it's stable.
- [ ] Fix overall mapping structure heirarchy
- [ ] Finish out all vim (esp. ui at this point) groups
- [ ] Integrate with http://bashish.sourceforge.net/ ?
- [ ] Blog entry
- [ ] Announce
- [ ] Script to help others quickly generate "detailed" syntax highlight versions of their favorite syntaxes. (gives them a quick list of all the things they can map, then they map them against the autocolors heirarchy and it generates the final product).

## Recently Done ##
- [D] A real good sample syntax/document with "common" densities for displaying full colorsheme - both standard and extended.
- [D] Autogenerate some vim examples in order to test colorschemes generally for iterating
- [D] Change mapping a bit so that one tick is very small variation, and more ticks increase but linearly, and use more ticks in most places.
- [D] Fix highlight color so it's more coherent
- [D] Fix TODO / etc. so they're more coherent
- [D] Set initial colors so they have the same chromacity and somewhat distributed hue
