- Fix highlight color so it's more coherent
- Fix TODO / etc. so they're more coherent
- Change mapping a bit so that one tick is very small variation, and more ticks
  increase but linearly, and use more ticks in most places.
- Integrate with http://bashish.sourceforge.net/ ?
- Script to help others quickly generate "detailed" syntax highlight versions
  of their favorite syntaxes. (gives them a quick list of all the things they
  can map, then they map them against the autocolors heirarchy and it generates
  the final product).
